> Work hard, be kind and amazing things will happen - Conan O'Brien

Hey there, welcome to my blog!

This is the place where I love sharing all sorts of random things about my life. I'm super passionate about writing🖋, creating🔮, and surfing.🏄‍

As you can see from the quote above, I believe that kindness will save the world. (And yes, I watched *Everything Everywhere All At Once* more than I should have.)

Anyway, I really hope you enjoy your time here, cheers!
